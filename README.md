# your-relationship-analysis-neurochemically
Analyze the emotional journey of your relationship/friendship through Neural Networks

# Narrative Relationship Analyzer

A React-based neural network visualization tool that analyzes relationship narratives through the lens of neuroscience.

## Features

- **Multi-phase storytelling**: Guided narrative collection across relationship stages
- **Neural network visualization**: Real-time canvas-based network rendering
- **Neurochemical analysis**: Analyzes text for oxytocin, dopamine, serotonin, and endorphin patterns
- **Relationship insights**: AI-powered insights based on narrative analysis
- **Interactive UI**: Modern, responsive design with animations

## How It Works

1. **Phase 1 - Early Bonding**: Share how your relationship began
2. **Phase 2 - Challenges**: Describe difficulties you've navigated together  
3. **Phase 3 - Current State**: Reflect on where your relationship stands today
4. **Analysis**: AI analyzes your narrative and generates a neural network visualization

## Technologies Used

- React 18+ with Hooks
- Canvas API for network visualization
- Lucide React for icons
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Advanced text analysis algorithms

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/narrative-relationship-analyzer.git

## Usage

Import and use the component in your React application:

```jsx
import NarrativeRelationshipAnalyzer from './components/NarrativeRelationshipAnalyzer';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <NarrativeRelationshipAnalyzer />
    </div>
  );
}
```

## Features in Detail

### Neural Network Analysis
- Analyzes text for emotional markers and relationship dynamics
- Generates metrics for connection density, network strength, and pathway efficiency
- Creates visual network with nodes representing different neurochemical pathways

### Visualization
- Real-time animated neural network on HTML5 Canvas
- Color-coded pathways for different neurochemicals
- Dynamic node sizing based on relationship strength

### AI Insights
- Pattern recognition for trust, joy, emotional regulation, and comfort
- Relationship health scoring
- Personalized recommendations based on analysis
